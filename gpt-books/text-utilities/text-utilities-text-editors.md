# Text Editors

Text editors are software applications that are designed for creating and editing text files. Text editors can be used to generate programming language code, markup languages, and other structured or unstructured text documents.

## Features of Text Editors

Text editors typically have features such as syntax highlighting, code completion, and bracket matching to help users write and edit text more efficiently. Syntax highlighting is essential for programmers as it highlights keywords, functions, and other language constructs in different colors for easy identification. Code completion, also known as auto-complete, is another feature that saves time and increases productivity by automatically completing code statements as the user types. Bracket matching is a useful tool for ensuring code integrity as it highlights the corresponding opening and closing brackets.

## Types of Text Editors

There are two main types of text editors: command-line and graphical. Command-line text editors are typically used in a terminal or shell environment and are controlled using keyboard commands. Examples of command-line text editors include Vi/Vim, Emacs, and Nano. Graphical text editors, on the other hand, are designed using graphical user interfaces and are controlled using mouse clicks and keyboard shortcuts. Examples of graphical text editors include Sublime Text, Atom, and Notepad++.
