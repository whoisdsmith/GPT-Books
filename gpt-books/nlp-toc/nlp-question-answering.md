# Question Answering

Question Answering (QA) is a subfield of Natural Language Processing (NLP) which focuses on developing systems that can automatically answer questions posed in natural language. This is different from Information Retrieval (IR) systems which return documents or web pages relevant to a user's query, without actually answering the question directly.

QA can be categorized into two types, **fact-based** and **opinion-based**. Fact-based QA systems are designed to give straightforward and objective answers to questions like "What is the capital city of France?" or "When was Albert Einstein born?". Opinion-based QA systems, on the other hand, are designed to provide subjective or interpretive answers to questions like "What is the best smartphone currently available?" or "What do you think about the recent US presidential election?".

## Approaches to QA

There are two main approaches to QA: **extraction-based** and **generation-based**.

### Extraction-based QA

In an extraction-based QA system, the answer to a question is extracted directly from a corpus of structured or unstructured data, such as a knowledge base, document collection, or web page. This typically involves the use of Named Entity Recognition (NER), Part-of-Speech (POS) tagging, Dependency Parsing, and other NLP techniques to identify relevant pieces of information that can answer the question.

Example: Given the question "Who played Iron Man in the Marvel Cinematic Universe?", an extraction-based QA system might scan a knowledge base or a document collection to find the answer "Robert Downey Jr.".

### Generation-based QA

In a generation-based QA system, the answer to a question is generated from scratch by the system using natural language generation techniques. This typically involves the use of a language model or a question-answering model that has been trained on a large corpus of text and can generate answers to questions based on the patterns and structures it has learned.

Example: Given the question "What do you think about the recent US presidential election?", a generation-based QA system might generate a subjective answer like "I think the recent US presidential election was highly controversial and polarizing, with both sides fiercely divided over the issues and the candidates."

## Evaluation of QA Systems

The effectiveness of a QA system can be evaluated based on a number of metrics, such as precision, recall, F1-score, accuracy, and Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR). These metrics measure the system's ability to correctly answer questions, as well as its ability to provide relevant and useful information to the user.

Example: A QA system might achieve a precision score of 90%, indicating that 9 out of 10 answers provided by the system are correct.

## Applications of QA

QA systems have a wide range of applications in industries such as education, healthcare, e-commerce, customer service, and more. They can be used to automate customer support, assist with research and education, provide medical assistance, and more.

Example: A QA system might be used in e-commerce to answer customer questions like "What is the shipping cost for this product?" or "What is the return policy for this item?".
