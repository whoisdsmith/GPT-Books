# Handling User Inputs

Handling user inputs is an essential task in any chatbot or conversational agent's system. It involves collecting and processing the input from the user to determine the appropriate response. In this chapter, we will discuss the necessary steps involved in handling user inputs.

## Collecting user inputs

The first step in handling user inputs is to collect them. Chatbots can collect user inputs through various means, such as text entry, voice recognition, and button presses. The most common method used is text entry, where the user types in their message or question.

## Preprocessing user inputs

Once the chatbot has collected the user's input, it needs to preprocess it. Preprocessing involves cleaning and normalizing the text to make it easier to understand for the chatbot. Common preprocessing steps include removing punctuation, converting all characters to lowercase, and replacing contractions with their expanded forms.

## Extracting intents and entities

After preprocessing the user's input, the chatbot needs to extract the user's intent and entities from the text. Intents refer to the user's goal or purpose in their message, while entities refer to the relevant pieces of information mentioned in the message. For example, in the user input "Book a flight to New York next Monday," the intent is to book a flight, and the entities are "New York" and "next Monday."

## Resolving user inputs

After extracting the intent and entities, the chatbot needs to resolve the user's input to determine the appropriate response. This involves using the intent and entities to determine the context of the user's message and identify the optimal response.

## Providing responses

Once the chatbot has resolved the user's input, it needs to provide an appropriate response. The response should be relevant to the user's input and provide the information or action requested.

## Examples

Here are some examples of handling user inputs:

**Example 1:**

User Input: What is the weather like today?

Preprocessed Input: weather today

Intent: request\_weather\_report

Entities: today

Resolved Input: request\_weather\_report(today)

Response: The weather today is sunny with a high of 75 degrees.

**Example 2:**

User Input: How do I cancel my subscription?

Preprocessed Input: cancel subscription

Intent: cancel\_subscription

Entities: None

Resolved Input: cancel\_subscription

Response: To cancel your subscription, please call our customer service department at 555-1234.

**Example 3:**

User Input: Can you recommend a good Italian restaurant in the area?

Preprocessed Input: recommend Italian restaurant area

Intent: recommend\_restaurant

Entities: Italian, area

Resolved Input: recommend\_restaurant(Italian, area)

Response: I would recommend trying out Pasta Bella. They have some of the best Italian food in the area.
