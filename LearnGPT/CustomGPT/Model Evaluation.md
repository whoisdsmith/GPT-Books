# Model Evaluation

After training our custom chatbot using GPT, we need to evaluate its performance to determine its accuracy and effectiveness. Model evaluation is a crucial step in building a high-quality chatbot that can communicate easily with humans.

To evaluate our model, we can use several metrics and techniques, including perplexity scores, accuracy, and human evaluation.

## Perplexity Scores

Perplexity is a standard measurement technique to evaluate the language model's quality. It is calculated by dividing the total number of probability distributions by the geometric average of the model's probabilities. The lower the perplexity score, the better is the language model's performance.

Perplexity is widely used in Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, including machine translation, speech recognition, and text classification. It evaluates the probability of the text by the language model, and the lower the perplexity, the more likely the text is.

## Accuracy

Accuracy is another widely used metric to evaluate chatbots, which measures the percentage of correct responses given by the chatbot during a specific period. This metric is determined by comparing the chatbot responses to the correct answers provided by humans.

It is crucial to select an appropriate training dataset and to validate the chatbot's accuracy accordingly. Inadequate training data or biased training data can drastically affect the chatbot's accuracy.

## Human Evaluation

A critical feature of chatbots is how well they communicate with humans. Human evaluation is a subjective evaluation method that measures the chatbot's effectiveness in terms of its naturalness, fluency, and overall quality.

Human evaluation can be conducted by having users interact with the chatbot and providing feedback on its performance. The feedback can include the chatbot's ability to answer questions correctly, its speed of response, its ease of use, and the user's level of satisfaction with the interaction.

## Examples

Suppose we have trained a chatbot to answer people's questions about a particular product or service. We can use perplexity scores to evaluate the chatbot's performance by testing how well it understands and responds to the user queries.

We can also use accuracy to evaluate the chatbot's effectiveness by comparing its responses to the correct answers provided by humans. Finally, we can use human evaluation to assess the chatbot's overall quality and naturalness.

Overall, model evaluation is a crucial step in building a successful chatbot that can effectively communicate with humans. By using appropriate metrics and using the feedback provided by users, we can improve the chatbot's performance significantly.
