# Decryption

Decryption is the process of converting an encrypted message back to its original form. Encryption is the process of converting plain text into a code, and decryption reverses this process to convert the code back into plain text.

There are a number of encryption methods, and each method has a corresponding decryption method. The most common encryption methods are symmetric-key encryption and public-key encryption.

In symmetric-key encryption, the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. In this method, the sender and the receiver both have the same key. This method is often used for secure communications between two individuals or systems.

Public-key encryption, also known as asymmetric encryption, uses two keys - a public key and a private key. The public key is used to encrypt the message, and the private key is used to decrypt the message. This method is often used in online transactions, such as online shopping, as it ensures that the message can only be read by the intended recipient.

Decryption can also refer to the process of recovering data that has been lost or corrupted. In this context, decryption is used to recover the original data from a backup or from a system's recovery files.

## Examples

Here are some examples of decryption:

### Symmetric-key encryption

Suppose Alice and Bob want to exchange a secret message. They can agree upon a shared key before exchanging messages. Once they have agreed upon a key, they can use symmetric-key encryption to encode and decode messages.

1. Alice creates a message, "Hello Bob."
2. Alice encrypts the message using a symmetric-key algorithm with the shared key, resulting in the encrypted message "wR23hdls4Eak".
3. Alice sends the encrypted message to Bob.
4. Bob receives the message and decrypts it using the same shared key, resulting in the original message "Hello Bob."

### Public-key encryption

Suppose Alice wants to send a message to Bob securely. Bob has a public key that Alice can use to encrypt the message. Alice can then send the encrypted message to Bob. Bob then uses his private key to decrypt the message and read it.

1. Alice creates a message, "Hello Bob."
2. Alice encrypts the message using Bob's public key, resulting in the encrypted message "q5HdS7wKej."
3. Alice sends the encrypted message to Bob.
4. Bob receives the message and decrypts it using his private key, resulting in the original message "Hello Bob."

### Data recovery

Suppose Alice accidentally deletes a file that she needs. She realizes that she has a backup of the file and wants to recover the original data.

1. Alice accesses her backup and downloads the encrypted file.
2. Alice enters her decryption key, which she used to encrypt the file originally, into the decryption program.
3. The decryption program decrypts the file, resulting in the original file.
