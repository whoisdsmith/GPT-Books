# Text Summarization

Text summarization is a process of creating a short, compressed and coherent version of a longer text while preserving the most important information. This technique is essential for reducing the amount of data that needs to be scrutinized by readers, especially in the age of big data.

Text summarization can be broadly divided into two categories: extractive summarization and abstractive summarization.

## Extractive summarization

Extractive summarization is a method of summarization in which the most important sentences of the text are extracted and rearranged to create a summary. This method relies on finding the most informative and relevant sentences by examining the frequency of certain words or phrases.

An example of extractive summarization is the algorithm used by Google to generate brief summaries of web pages in its search results. This algorithm identifies the most important sentences on a web page by analyzing word frequency, sentence length and other factors.

## Abstractive summarization

Abstractive summarization involves creating a summary that uses new phrases and sentences to capture the essence of the original text. This method is more challenging than extractive summarization because it requires generating new language that accurately represents the meaning of the original text.

An example of abstractive summarization is the AI-powered summarization system developed by Salesforce. This system analyzes large amounts of text data and creates summaries using advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques.

## Techniques and applications

There are several techniques and applications of text summarization, including:

- News summarization: creating summary of news articles for quick reading.
- Keyword-based summarization: selecting sentences containing specific keywords.
- Topic-based summarization: selecting sentences based on the topic.
- Reddit summarization: generating short summaries of Reddit posts and threads.
- Document summarization: summarizing long documents such as legal documents or academic papers.

In conclusion, text summarization is an essential technique for reducing the amount of data that needs to be read and analyzed. With the development of advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, the quality of text summarization has greatly improved in recent years, making it more useful for a wide range of applications.
