# Conversational Context

In chatbot development, context is a essential feature for creating an intelligent and adaptable chatbot capable of answering complex user queries. Contextual understanding can be understood and analyzed by the chatbot through conversational context.

Conversational context is defined as the set of information that assists chatbots to understand the context of a sentence or phrase spoken by the user. To improve the performance of chatbots in selecting the most relevant response, it is important to consider the context of the conversation or dialogue.

Providing context to your chatbot helps in anticipating the user's intentions and delivering more precise responses. A chatbot that uses conversational context can identify and respond to user requests more accurately, thereby enhancing the quality of the user experience.

The context in which a sentence appears is crucial to its meaning. Therefore, it is important for a chatbot to have a comprehensive understanding of the text and the meaning of each word to determine the correct response. To assist in the creation of such chatbots, natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used to determine the context of each sentence.

For example, consider the question “What is the weather like today?” If a user asks this question in Antarctica, the appropriate chatbot response would be different than if the user asked the same question in San Francisco. If the chatbot doesn’t account for the context, it would provide the same response in both cases, failing to provide complete information to the user.

Another example is “Can I have coffee?” If an individual inquires "Can I have coffee?" in the evening, the chatbot is expected to respond with "Sure." However, if the individual asks this question in the morning, the chatbot is expected to respond with "Do you want the same coffee as yesterday?"

The conversational context also includes the dialogue history between the chatbot and the user, providing a chronological context to the conversation overall. This information is critical to understanding and responding to the user's intent for an intelligent chatbot. By retaining previous dialogue history, the chatbot can continue the conversation without having to re-introduce its purpose, enabling it to understand what the user wishes to discuss and how to respond.

In conclusion, conversational context is a critical aspect of chatbot development that enables the chatbot to understand and respond appropriately to messages in the appropriate context. Using techniques such as NLP, developers can teach chatbots to understand the context of each conversation and respond to the user's query more accurately, leading to quality user experience in chatbot interaction.
