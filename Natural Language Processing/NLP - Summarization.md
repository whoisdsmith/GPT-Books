# Summarization

Summarization is the process of creating a shorter version of a lengthy text document while retaining the most important information. It is a critical task in Natural Language Processing (NLP) that can be used to improve the speed and efficiency of processing large amounts of text.

There are two main types of summarization: extractive and abstractive. In extractive summarization, important sentences or phrases are extracted from the original text and compiled into a summary. This method requires less understanding of the content and language, but may not result in a coherent summary. On the other hand, abstractive summarization involves generating new sentences that convey the same meaning as the original text, but in a shorter format. This method is more challenging but often results in more coherent summaries.

There are several approaches used in summary generation, including statistical approaches and machine learning algorithms. One common method is the TextRank algorithm, which ranks sentences by their importance through the use of graph-based models. Another popular algorithm is the Transformer, which uses a neural network model to generate abstractive summaries.

Summarization has applications in various domains, such as news articles, research papers, and social media. For example, news agencies use summarization to provide brief news summaries for their readers. Research journals use summarization to highlight the key findings of research papers to aid in decision-making by researchers. Social media platforms use summarization to condense posts or tweets into a shorter format to provide a better user experience.

Here are some examples of summary generation:

**Extractive Summarization example:**

Original Text: "Scientists have discovered a new species of beetle that feeds primarily on the petals of flowering plants. The beetle was found in the rainforests of South America, and it is believed to have evolved to its specialized diet due to competition with other beetle species. The newly discovered beetle has been named Petalocola uniflora."

Summary: "A new species of beetle, Petalocola uniflora, has been discovered in South America. It feeds on the petals of flowering plants and is believed to have evolved due to competition with other beetle species."

**Abstractive Summarization example:**

Original Text: "The United Nations reports that global temperatures are expected to rise by 2 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, leading to significant changes in weather patterns and rising sea levels. The report also states that urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to prevent the worst effects of climate change."

Summary: "The United Nations warns that rising global temperatures will cause drastic changes to weather patterns and sea levels. Urgent action is needed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to prevent the worst effects of climate change."
